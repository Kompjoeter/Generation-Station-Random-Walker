# Generation Station (Random Walker)

# Description
A tiny library of functions to generate paths with the Random Walker technique coupled with the p5.js library
and a canvas to draw the generated paths onto.

The scripts in the 'drawing-scripts' folder are examples of how you can use the Walker.js library (+ the p5.js library) to create a variety of ways to draw generative-art onto the canvas. Which are then initalized and called in sketch.js.

This project was made to experiment with the Random Walker technique and have its results be visible on screen. In the future I might add different techniques (For example: flow-fields, perlin-noise) to the Generation Station which then also can be used to create a variety of generative-art.
